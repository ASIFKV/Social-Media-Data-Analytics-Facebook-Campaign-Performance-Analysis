# Social-Media-Data-Analytics-Facebook-Campaign-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes the Facebook advertising campaign run by 365 Data Science to sell one of their online courses. Using Python and standard data-science libraries, the analysis examines campaigns, audience targeting, ad creative performance, and conversion funnels to measure how effectively the campaign turned impressions into course sales.

The work covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and performance evaluation across core marketing KPIs — impressions, reach, clicks, CTR, conversions, conversion rate, cost per click (CPC), cost per acquisition (CPA), return on ad spend (ROAS), CPM, and frequency. The project identifies which audiences, creatives, placements, and bid strategies drove the most cost-efficient enrollments and highlights opportunities to increase ROI.
